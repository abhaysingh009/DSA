This program generates a square matrix of size N × N (filled with numbers 1 to N×N in row-major order) and prints a chosen pattern (A, D, X, or Z) using the matrix values.

Non-pattern positions are replaced with 0.

The program also computes and displays the sum of all numbers used in the pattern.

Input Format 
● First line: A character ch (Z, D, A, X). 
● Second line: An integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 20). 
Output Format 
● The N × N matrix where only the chosen pattern positions keep their values, all 
others are 0. 
● The sum of all values included in the pattern. 
Constraints 
● 3 ≤ N ≤ 20 
● Pattern is guaranteed to be one of {Z, D, A, X}

Useful for practicing 2D  Array Questions,pattern printing.
