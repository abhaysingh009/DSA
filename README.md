This program generates a square matrix of size N × N (filled with numbers 1 to N×N in row-major order) and prints a chosen pattern (Z, D, A, or X) using the matrix values.

Non-pattern positions are replaced with 0.

The program also computes and displays the sum of all numbers used in the pattern.

Useful for practicing 2D  Array Questions,pattern printing.
